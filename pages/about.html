          Hi, my name is Oli and I want to make to make applications that are
          awesome for everyone.
        </p>
        <p>
          For the last two years I've have worked on a project called digital
          inclusion, which aims to teach essential skills and provide
          opportunities for people that have been excluded from technology.
        </p>
        <p>
          The project got me working with computers, mobile phones and the
          internet every day. I wanted to make a website to publicly store
          resources and technologies and this led me to build my first website
          using Wix. It was this experience that led me to the world of HTML,
          CSS, JavaScript and ultimately to where I am now in my coding journey.
        </p>
        <p>
          Throughout the project i've gained an acute awareness that many web
          and software applications fail the very people that could benefit from
          such technologies the most.
        </p>
        <p>
          Check out my 'inclusion page' to see examples of inclusive web
          development
        </p>
        <p>
          The second focus of this application is 'mental health', a topic that
          I really care about and an area I have been fortunate to work in.
        </p>
        <p>
          Check out my 'mental health tools' page to find a variety of mental
          health tools built with JavaScript.
