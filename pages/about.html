          Hi, my name is Oli and I want to make to make web apps that are
          awesome for <mark>everyone.</mark>
        </p>
        <p>
          For the last two years I have worked on a project called digital
          inclusion, which aims to teach essential skills and provide
          opportunities for people that have been excluded from technology.
        </p>
        <p>
          The project got me working with computers, mobile phones and the
          internet every day. There was something magical about showing people
          what they could do with modern tech. I wanted to make a website to
          publicly store resources for coaching work and this led me to build my
          <a target="blank" href="https://digiinclusion.wixsite.com/london"
            >first website</a
          >
          using Wix. It was this experience that led me to the world of HTML,
          CSS, JavaScript and ultimately to where I am now in my coding journey.
        </p>
        <p>
          Throughout the project i've gained an acute awareness that many web
          and software applications fail the very people that could benefit from
          such technologies the most. I want to change that and build software
          that is useful, fast and enjoyable for all.
        </p>
        <p>
          Check out my
          <a href="./inclusive.html">Inclusive development page</a> to see some
          examples of inclusive web development.
        </p>
        <p>
          The second focus of my application site is 'mental health', a topic
          that I really care about and an area I have been fortunate to work in
          over the last three years.
        </p>
        <p>
          Check out my <a href="./tools.html">Digital health</a> page to find a
          variety of digital mental and physical health tools built with
          JavaScript.
        </p>
        <p>
          I believe that I'm a good fit for the Founders and Coders programme
          because I've come to realise through training, studying and working
          that the times I have been most motivated, engaged and resilient have
          been the times when I truly felt part of a group. I enjoy explaining
          and exploring code with others just as much as learning, following and
          building. The coaching groups have given me insight into the
          co-operative and collaborative ethos of the programme and has helped
          me build the confidence to bring my experience and values to the web
          developer developer community.
