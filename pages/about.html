          Hi, my name is Oli and I want to make web apps that are awesome for
          <mark>everyone.</mark>
        </p>
        <p>
          For the last three years I have worked on a community project called
          digital inclusion, which aims to teach essential skills and provide
          opportunities for people who have been excluded from technology.
        </p>
        <p>
          The project got me working with computers, mobile phones and the
          internet every day. There was something magical about showing people
          what they could do with modern tech. During the pandemic I wanted to
          make a website to publicly store resources for coaching work and this
          led me to build my
          <a target="blank" href="https://digiinclusion.wixsite.com/london"
            >first website</a
          >
          using Wix. It was this experience that led me to the world of HTML,
          CSS, JavaScript and ultimately to where I am now in my coding journey.
        </p>
        <p>
          Throughout the project i've gained an acute awareness that many web
          and software applications fail the very people who could benefit from
          such technologies the most. I want to change that and build software
          that is useful, fast and enjoyable for all.
        </p>
        <p>
          Check out my
          <a href="./inclusive.html">Inclusive development page</a> to see some
          examples of inclusive web development in practice.
        </p>
        <p>
          The second focus of my application site is 'mental health', a topic
          that is very important to me. As part of my public involvement in
          research work at the McPin Foundation I have seen a flurry of
          development in the field of technology for mental health and
          wellbeing, including a mobile app to help with paranoia, and a virtual
          reality therapy for psychosis. I would love to develop in this space
          in the future using the skills from the apprencticeship to create
          quality software that has an impact.
        </p>
        <p>
          Check out my
          <a href="./tools.html">Digital health</a> page to explore a digital
          health tool I built with JavaScript.
        </p>
        <p>
          I believe that I'm a good fit for the Founders and Coders programme
          because I've come to realise through training, studying and working
          that the times I have been most motivated, engaged and resilient have
          been the times when I truly felt part of a group. I enjoy explaining
          and exploring code with others just as much as learning, following and
          building. The coaching groups have given me insight into the
          co-operative and collaborative ethos of the programme and has helped
          me build the confidence to share and critically reflect on my code and
          my thinking.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have spent most of my life working and studying in the healthcare
          and voluntary sector and I greatly enjoy helping others. I understand
          that web development involves delivering products and that companies
          have commercial goals and plans, but I also strongly believe in the
          social good that software and technology can promise. The projects at
          the 'Tech for Better' summer showcase were inspiring to me and align
          exactly with what type of work I would like to do in the future, I
          feel that Founders and Coders is a community that will help me be a
          'good' developer in the very broadest sense.
