          Hi, my name is Oli and I want to make to make web apps that are
          awesome for everyone.
        </p>
        <p>
          For the last two years I've have worked on a project called digital
          inclusion, which aims to teach essential skills and provide
          opportunities for people that have been excluded from technology.
        </p>
        <p>
          The project got me working with computers, mobile phones and the
          internet every day. I wanted to make a website to publicly store
          resources for coaching work and this led me to build my
          <a target="blank" href="https://digiinclusion.wixsite.com/london"
            >first website</a
          >
          using Wix. It was this experience that led me to the world of HTML,
          CSS, JavaScript and ultimately to where I am now in my coding journey.
        </p>
        <p>
          Throughout the project i've gained an acute awareness that many web
          and software applications fail the very people that could benefit from
          such technologies the most.
        </p>
        <p>
          Check out my 'inclusive development page' to see some examples of
          inclusive web development.
        </p>
        <p>
          The second focus of my application site is 'mental health', a topic
          that I really care about and an area I have been fortunate to work in.
        </p>
        <p>
          Check out my 'mental health tools' page to find a variety of mental
          health tools built with JavaScript.
